## Austin Turner

### About Me

Hey!
My name is Austin Turner and I am currently a student at the University of Mississippi. I spend most of my time at school and work but when I do get free time, I like to enjoy my most favorite hobby, video games. To some it may seem nerdy but to me it's a sport. You see, here at the University of Mississippi, I have found and became deeply invested into the Esports program, which is a collegiate sporting program for video games, and have achieved the honor of being the programs Head of Community. With that being said, I work well with others and quite frankly enjoy the company of people from all walks of life.

Even though I have a deep passion for video gaming, I still strive to be the best I can be at both school and work. I am currently a member of two honor societies, Phi Theta Kappa and Gamma Beta Phi, and am a General Studies major. Within general studies, which is comprised of three minors, I study Computer Science, Digital Media, and Professional writing. This seems to keep me very much entertained when not playing video games. School is not the only important thing though, I am currently a student worker for the Information Technology department in athletics for the University and love every minute of it. I've always been very geeky when it comes to technology, so having a job where all I do is fix said technology really makes me happy. I absolutely adore the people I work with and enjoy being able to teach new students the trade and how to work with all sorts of technology, from desktop computers to raspberry pi's. So, this is my life concisely summed up into a couple paragraphs. I'd love to talk about anything with anybody so if you ever have a question about me or anything I do, feel free to shoot me an email and chat.

 I currently plan on staying involved    
 in Collegiate Esports by continuing     
 to work for the University and          
 working towards obtaining a directors   
 role within the program and later       
 moving on to the professional Esports   
 scene.                                  
                                         
 If life gets in the way like it usually
 does, I have a plan for staying involved
 within the IT community. My perfect plan
 would be to work for a game developer or
 publishing company for video games,
 that way I continue to do the things
 I love. Video gaming, Esports and IT.
